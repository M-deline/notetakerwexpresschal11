## Description
* The purpose of this application was to practice JavaScript and Node.js to create the back-end for this application. I used Express.js and created a server to connect the front and back end and deployed it to heroku to deploy it. The application allows the user to create a new note and then the user is able to save the note and later the user can open the note up to view it again or delete it once they complete it. 
## Challenges & Successes
* The biggest challenge I had was deploying this application to heroku. I kept getting error and I changed the file structure and updated the code following the instructions from the heroku website when it was deploying. I also had to add a npm start script to the package.json file.
* I had issues with GitHub and to fix this I created a new repo and it worked.
* The challenge was a success because the user is able to write notes and click on the left side to view the notes later and they can delete a note or save it once finished.
